# Backgroun Information

This project is prepared by Aniket Anil Walimbe and Chuanni He. It
created a vignette for reading and summarizing data from one of the
[Financial data API](https://polygon.io/docs/getting-started).

# Requirements

To use the functions for interacting with the Financial API, We used the
following packages:  
\* `httr`: Tools for Working with URLs and HTTP \* `jsonlite`: A JSON
parser/generator optimized for the web. Its main strength is that it
implements a bidirectional mapping between JSON data and the most
important R data types.

``` r
# Required library and key information
key = "EByG3OEye377G2rI0LRah2CUjGplA7TB"
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```

# API Interaction Functions

This section talks about how we define the functions to interact with
the Financial API, as well as some helper functions working with data
manipulation.

`Aggregates`

Our first function is to obtain the highest price for a stock over a
given date range in custom time window sizes. This function interacts
with the `Aggregates (Bars)` endpoint of the API. `stock` parameter
refers to the ticker of the referred company. For example, the stock
ticker for Apple Inc.Â is `AAPL`. Either lower-case or capital letters
are acceptable. The second parameter `multiplier` refers to the time
multiplier for the acquired data. For example, if the `timespan` is
`day`, then `multiplier` of `5` indicates that 5-minute bars will be
obtained. `multiplier` should be integer values. The last parameter
`timespan` refers to the size of the time window. The possible values
are `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`. Either
lower-case or capital letters are acceptable. This function will return
the close price in the given time period between 2021-7-22 to 2022-7-22
with a maximum data length of 200 records. The returned data type is
data frame.

``` r
Aggregates = function(stock,multiplier, timespan) {
  # generate the URL
  base = "https://api.polygon.io/v2/aggs/"
  Endpoint = "ticker"
  stock = toupper(stock)
  timespan = tolower(timespan)
  call = paste(base,Endpoint,"/",stock,"/range/",multiplier,"/",timespan,
               "/2021-07-22/2022-07-22?adjusted=true&sort=asc&limit=200&apiKey=",
               key, sep = "")
  # Acquire the data
  get = GET(call)
  content = content(get)
  # store and return the data
  price = data.frame()
  ## the close price
  close = c()
  for (i in 1:length(content$results)) {
    close = rbind(close,content$results[[i]]$c)
  }
  ## the highest price
  highest = c()
  for (i in 1:length(content$results)) {
    highest = rbind(highest,content$results[[i]]$h)
  }
  ## the lowest price
  lowest = c()
  for (i in 1:length(content$results)) {
    lowest = rbind(lowest,content$results[[i]]$l)
  }
  ## the open price
  open = c()
  for (i in 1:length(content$results)) {
    open = rbind(open,content$results[[i]]$o)
  }
  
  # Aggregate data into data frame
  price = data.frame(open = open, close = close, highest = highest, lowest = lowest)
  return(price)
}
```

`GetNews`

The second function acquires the most recent news articles relating to a
stock ticker. The summary of the article and the link to the original
article are also included. Three parameters are included in this
function. The `ticker` is the stock ticker of the company. Either
lower-case or capital letters are acceptable. The `published` parameter
refers to the date on witch the news is published. The data type is
string and the format should be `yyyy-mm-dd`. The third parameter
y`limit` limits the number of news will be returned from the function.
The data type is integer. This function returns a structured list
including multiple information regarding each news such as publisher,
author, title, keywords, etc.

``` r
GetNews = function(ticker, published, limit) {
  ticker = toupper(ticker)
  # generate the URL
  base = "https://api.polygon.io/v2/reference/"
  Endpoint = "news"
  call = paste(base,Endpoint,"?ticker=",ticker,"&published_utc=",published,
               "&limit=",limit, "&apiKey=", key, sep = "")
  # Acquire the data
  get = GET(call)
  content = content(get)
  return(content$results)
}
```

`Detail`

The third function gets a single ticker supported by Polygon.io. This
response will have detailed information about the ticker and the company
behind it.############

``` r
Detail = function(ticker,date) {
  ticker = toupper(ticker)
  # generate the URL
  base = "https://api.polygon.io/v3/"
  Endpoint = "reference"
  call = paste(base,Endpoint,"/tickers/",ticker,"?date=",date, 
               "&apiKey=", key, sep = "")
  # Acquire the data
  get = GET(call)
  content = content(get)
  return(content$results)
}
```

``` r
stock = "aapl"
multiplier = 1
timespan = "day"
Aggregates(stock,multiplier,timespan)

news = GetNews(stock,"2021-07-01",10)
```
